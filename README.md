## Purpose:
### This is an exercise to Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles, Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles, and Add Bootstrap 3 Components
## Background
### This clallenge is to polish the web app made during the homework. To do that, I will adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. I will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
